# Lossy Image Compression
Image downsampling, discrete cosine transform, quantization, etc. implemented using Numpy and Scipy. More details [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-lost-in-jpeg-e5e6e80b1f94).

## Usage
- main.py: main script for compressing image.
- utils.py: utility functions for different stages of compression.
- extras.py: implementation of some utility functions using loops for readability.

## Requirements
- numpy
- scipy
- PIL (Pillow)
- cv2 (opencv-python)
- rawpy
